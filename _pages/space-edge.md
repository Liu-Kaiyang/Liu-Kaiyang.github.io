## Project Discription 

In recent years, the concept of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite based space edge computing has captured the imagination of technology enthusiasts and industry experts alike. The idea of hosting data storage and processing facilities in outer space presents a compelling vision of the future, promising unparalleled scalability, energy efficiency, and reduced latency, benefiting a wide range of applications, from financial transactions to real-time communication and remote sensing. My previous research focuses on the design and analysis of distributed optimization and artificial intelligence solutions that span across cloud/edge networks, data center networks, and satellite communication networks to meet the stringent requirements arising from data-intensive applications. Among my most significant contributions are novel solutions in computing task scheduling, data placement, and caching to achieve high efficiency, low overhead, and scalability. (Related previous research work can be found [here](https://liu-kaiyang.github.io/publications/)) These solutions should be revisited to ensure low latency, high throughput, and network resilience under varying traffic conditions and satellite configurations for future LEO satellite data centers. Deploying a coast-to-coast-to-coast LEO satellite networks (LSNs) testbed can help us further our understanding about the potential challenges and opportunities associated with space-based data centers.
